## Goals of this module
* This hands on tutorial will teach you how to investigate the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, through bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis, and interpret the results to inform public health interventions.

## Learning Objectives
* Building a background dataset by retrieving sequences from public databases
  * Alignment viewer and editing software
  * Identify the study sequences’ lineage
  * Access sequences on public genetic databases
  * Assembly of the background dataset
* Bioinformatics towards phylogenetics
  * Selection of a reference genome
  * Alignment software
  * Inspection and manual curation of the alignment
  * Appropriate subsample of the background dataset for computational efficiency
* Phylogenetic analysis
  * Components of a phylogeny
  * Inference algorithms and software
  * Interpretation
  * Phylogenetic signal consideration for advances phylodynamic modeling

## Background On phylogenetic analysis

## Reference-guided assembly

The first step to starting phylogenetic analysis --> context to DNAnexus

*Connect to your DNAnexus instance and open up a shell prompt.*

Install XYZ
```
conda install -c bioconda -y XYZ
```

Accesws the data: FIXME
```
cd awesome_data

```
This dataset contains paired end reads.
